A Bolero trial run with a simple example. 
Bolero gives the F# developer the power of .NET/WASM/Blazor flexibly with that Elmish flow.
It was a fantastic developer experience, highly recommended.

### The Stack: F#, Bolero (Full-stack, Elmish), Tailwindcss, Storj

Run it:
```
dotnet run --project src/blogero-app.Server
```
